<h1>Goobstation LRP</h1>
<p>Unlike Wizden, GS14 chemistry is <i>very</i> much on the longer recipe side. The six core meds are all combinations of two to four of a thing that itself needs like three of another thing (holy peak terminology)
<br>
Additionally, like half of them use ammonia or oil, so I'd recommend you fuck off to maints roundstart for a welding fuel tank. It's not optional here.
<br>
Many of the wizchems have been buffed in some way, but we don't care because we can mix like 360 sali that performs 3x better and more efficiently in 30 seconds</p>
<h2>Core(â‰ˆ) Meds</h2>
<p>auuuuughhhhhhhhhhhhhh
<br>
<b>Salicyic Acid:</b> brute med. basically acts like puncturase, lacerinol and bruizine all in one.
<br>
<b>Oxandrolone:</b> burn med. same thing but for burns. and god came down to earth and said - i bless upon you derma if it wasnt shit
<br>
<b>Artiplates:</b> saline on steroids, heals blood level and bloodloss. fuckass 10u od and ashes at high temp so make sure your other meds are cold
<br>
<b><del>Tirimol</del> <ins>Dex+:</ins></b> Tirimol sucks. Do not fucking waste the oil needed to mix this abysmal dogshit. Dex+ is more than half as good for a quarter of the mixing time and 90% of the times when the patient has asphyxiation they ALSO HAVE BLOODLOSS AND IT ALSO DOES OVERTIME STAMINA DAMAGE? FUCK OFF HOLY SHIT. THERE ARE LIKE, TWO REAGENTS IN THE ENTIRE FUCKING GAME THAT CAUSE OVERTIME STAMINA AND ONE OF THEM IS FUCKING PROBITAL. IT NEEDS AT LEAST 20U. AND THIS SHIT HAS A 20% CHANCE TO FUCKING PARALYSE PER TICK. YOU START WITH IT IN MEDIPENS SO YOU CAN JUST STICK THE CHUD THAT'S ATTACKING YOU TO PARALYZE, STEAL THEIR SHIT AND KILL THEM. I WANT TO MURDER THE MAINT THAT MERGED THIS WITH A FUCKING CHAINSAW.
<br>
<b>Pentenic Acid:</b> toxin med. heals rads and poison, purges bloodstream like charcoal does (inject it last)
<br>
<b>Atropine:</b> stabiliser that heals everything, pretty good. I like.</p>
