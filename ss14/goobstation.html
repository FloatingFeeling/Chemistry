    <h1>Goobstation LRP</h1>
    <p>Unlike Wizden, GS14 chemistry is <i>very</i> much on the longer recipe side. The six core meds are all combinations of two to four of a thing that itself needs like three of another thing (holy peak terminology) <br> Additionally, like half of them use ammonia or oil, so I'd recommend you fuck off to maints roundstart for a welding fuel tank. It's not optional here. <br> Many of the wizchems have been buffed in some way, but we don't care because we can mix like 360 sali that performs 3x better and more efficiently in 30 seconds </p>
