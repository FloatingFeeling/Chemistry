    Unlike Wizden, GS14 chemistry is focused around reagents with massive recipe trees and complex conditions to induce mixing. This means that the disparity between a chud like you who has this guide and someone who doesn't is extremely high, as they're going to have to naviagate through 30 different menus to find the recipe for sulfuric acid while you have to do none of that. I've already gone over why I fucking hate the guidebook, but the problem is so obscenely worse here I couldn't not mention it. So, congrats. <br>Despite this, most of the new meds are rather intuitive in their precursors. Artiplates, the bloodloss med, consists of tranex and saline, along with the two metals blood is based off of (iron and copper).<br>These new chems are split into tiers, with the originals being T1 or T2, and the Core Meds being T3. There are also T4 chems, which are exclusively made with Aluite (a pain in the ass, so I don't do it much). If I remember correctly, this also affects how it reacts to different severity wounds in woundmed, but we're a chemist so we don't care.<br>Additionally, Oil and Ammonia are used so frequently that I don't care nor have the time needed to include mixes for it in every recipe. And Ammonia scales by 20. I'm not dealing with that shit.<br>Make them in advance. You can beakermix 100 Ammonia with 25 Nitrogen and 75 Hydrogen, and 75 Oil with 25 Welding Fuel, Carbon, and Oxygen. Fucking off to maints roundstart isn't optional.

    <h2>Core Meds</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Salicyic Acid - Brute.</b> Acts like a combination of the Advanced Brutes. Plummets in effectiveness when the target has 25 or less damage, but we're a chemist so we don't care.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Oxandrolone - Burn.</b> The same, for burns. Also heals caustic.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Artiplates - Bloodloss, Blood Level.</b> Literally just better saline with QOL in the form of stong bloodloss heal. Ashes at >520k, so make sure the patient isn't... that.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b><del>Tirimol</del> <ins>Dex+</ins> - Airloss.</b> Don't bother with Tirimol. I originally wrote out a multiple page document on every reason Why This Reagent Fucking Sucks but realised I was crashing out over a game from 2003 and abstained it.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Pentenic Acid - Toxin, Purges Bloodstream.</b> Charcoal, Arith, and Dylo. Requires 30 Plasma for a full batch because fuck you. Somehow, reinforced table deconstructing returned.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Atropine - Stabiliser.</b> Epi if it wasn't shit.
      </li>
    </ul>
